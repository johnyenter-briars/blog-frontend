# About Me?

Hi there! My name is John and I'm a (junior?) software engineer. 

I love programming but also kinda hate it.

For my day job, I mostly work in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) and [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/).

But by night, I love [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/). But mostly just Rust <3. 

I also love rock climbing, skateboarding, and playing random records I find at the record store.

While you're here, feel free to check out my [projects](/projects), maybe take a gander at my [posts](/writing) or friend me on discord! (parasite2019#9856) I'm always down to talk about programming! :)
