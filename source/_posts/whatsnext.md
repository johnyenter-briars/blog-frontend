### What's Been Going On With Me?

I don't quite know what to put in this blog, except my own thoughts and experiences since the last time I posted.

My [last blog post](/2022/02/07/mediasystem) was in 2022, and that already feels like a lifetime ago. Since then, I've made mistakes, built tons of software, and grown so much - in both my professional and personal life.

I've rebuild / refactored my media system *twice* in that same span. Each time I've been very happy with the results, but needed more features. The [current iteration](https://github.com/johnyenter-briars/harmonize) started out very ambitious, and had to be scaled back in order to get the project in a usable state. One day I hope to return to it and finish it out. Maybe I'll make a blog post on it someday.

Since 2022, I've started a band. Been very lucky that everyone wants to stick together, and we've been blessed to have the opportunity to play a few shows. One day I hope to post our music on here as well.

In my professional career I've become a tech lead, and currently oversee several projects. This experience has been new, stressful, and challenging. Developers are hard to manage!

### What's Been Going On With You?

I don't know if anyone is reading this. But if you are - how are you? What has changed in your live since 2022? Are you surprised? Did it take adjustment? I hope you're thriving regardless of what trials you face.

### What's Next With this Blog?

I'm not totally sure what's next with this space. I would like to write more - I'm not sure about what just yet.

I have several half-baked thoughts on AI (who doesn't), cloud computing, and the role of big tech that I hope to turn into blog posts in the near future. 

My next project will be a Rogue-Like Autobattler built in Unity. Maybe this blog will become a dev log for that... or at the very least it'll get it's own post when finished. 

Stay tuned!
