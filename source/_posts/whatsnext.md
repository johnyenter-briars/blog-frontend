### What's Been Going On With Me?

I don't quite know what to put in this blog, except my own thoughts and experiences since the last time I posted.

My [last blog post](XXX) was in 2022, and that already feels like a lifetime ago. Since then, I've made mistakes, built tons of software, and grown so much - in both my professional and personal life.

I've rebuild / refactored my [media system](XXX) *twice* in that same span. Each time I've been very happy with the results, but needed more features. The [current iteration](XXX) started out very ambitious, and had to be scaled back in order to get the project in a usable state. One day I hope to return to it and finish it out. Maybe I'll make a blog post on it someday.

Since 2022, I've started a band. Been very lucky that everyone wants to stick together, and we've been blessed to have the opportunity to play a few shows. One day I hope to post our music on here as well.

In my professional career I've become a tech lead, and currently oversee several projects. This experience has been new, stressful, and challenging. Developers are hard to manage!

### What's Been Going On With You?

I don't know if anyone is reading this. But if you are - how are you? What has changed in your live since 2022? Are you surprised? Did it take adjustment? I hope you're thriving regardless of what trials you face.

### What's Next With this Blog?

I'm not totally sure what's next with this space. I would like to write more - I'm not sure about what just yet.

I have several half-baked thoughts on AI (who doesn't), cloud computing, and the role of big tech that I hope to turn into blog posts in the near future. 

I would like to post more of my projects, and clean up some trailing TODOs for this blog. Hopefully those will also be done by the time this is posted. 

Stay tuned!
