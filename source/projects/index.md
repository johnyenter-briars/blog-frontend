# My Projects

### Harmonize

A multi-media management app + server. Designed to take in audio + video media from a variety of sources, and blend it seamlessly from a unified UI. Currently the app is in MVP status, as several critical features like audio are not fully implemented. I hope to finish it one day.

### gruvbox-material-vs

A simple yet elegant theme for Visual Studio designed to replicate the brilliant [Gruvbox Material](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sainnhe.gruvbox-material) plugin. I've been thrilled that ~4.5k people have given it a try!

### CAL

CAL is a simple app for CALendar management. Built on Maui and heavy use of [XCalendar](https://github.com/ME-MarvinE/XCalendar), CAL has been my daily calendar of choice for 3 years.

### Chess Engine

Chrust is a chess engine written in Rust. Its supposed to be a cute name combining the words "Chess" and "Rust". Its a simple AI, but suprisingly affective - if you can beat it, I'd love to hear about it!

### Reverse Date Parser

RDP is a web application allowing developers to insert a string formatted like a date. It then returns the possible date format strings that could compile to the given date string. Inspired by [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) its designed to reduce the ammount of times developers need to ask: "wait, does the string 'May' correspond to 'MMM' or '%M'?"

### Media-System

Media-System is an open source home media system I cobbled together using [LibreELEC OS](https://libreelec.tv/) installed on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). I then built an [Android App](https://github.com/johnyenter-briars/media-system-client) to control the system through its API.

I wrote a blog about the process [here](/2022/02/07/mediasystem).

### Automata Tutor Updates

Automata Tutor is this weird obtuse software developered by some phd researchers in Germany for constructing and distributing Automata theory problems to students.
For a summer research project in 2020, I worked with my professor to update it's functionality and UI.
