# My Projects

### Chess Engine

Chrust is a chess engine written in Rust. Its supposed to be a cute name combining the words "Chess" and "Rust". Its a simple AI, but suprisingly affective - if you can beat it, I'd love to hear about it!

### Reverse Date Parser

RDP is a web application allowing developers to insert a string formatted like a date. It then returns the possible date format strings that could compile to the given date string. Inspired by [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) its designed to reduce the ammount of times developers need to ask: "wait, does the string 'May' correspond to 'MMM' or '%M'?"

### Automata Tutor Updates

Automata Tutor is this weird obtuse software developered by some phd researchers in Germany for constructing and distributing Automata theory problems to students.
For a summer research project in 2020, I worked with my professor to update it's functionality and UI.
